<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Put your meat and 1/2 the onion in a deep enough dish to cover it with cold water leaving enough space on the top so that it doesn't boil over.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Bring to the boil, constantly removing the foam, Reduce heat to simmer when it starts to boil. Cover it.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Let it cook for about 2 1/2 hours or until the meat is tender and falling off the bone.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Meanwhile, prepare your noodle dough.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> In a bowl mix the sifted flour (300-400 g), the eggs (whisk the eggs before you add into flour), add salt and pour water until a dough is formed.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Knead pastry, adding flour or water as needed.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Knead the dough well, wrap in plastic wrap and leave for 20-30 minutes.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Sprinkle the work top with sifted flour and divide your dough into a few small balls
</p>
<p><strong>Step 9:</strong> Then keeping the worktop lightly covered with flour roll each piece of pastry into a fairly thin layer.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 10:</strong> Keep sprinkling with flour so that it doesn't stick to your hands or work surface.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 11:</strong> Cut into squares (10x10cm). Leave them on a worktop lightly covered with flour. The pieces should not touch or they will stick together. By the time you are ready to cook the noodles it should be dry a bit.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 12:</strong> minutes before your meat is ready, add the other half of the onion (cut in ring shapes), salt and pepper to taste, into your stock.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 13:</strong> Remove the meat and bones, separate as you will only serve the tender cooked meat.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 14:</strong> Bring the stock to a boil for about 7 or so minutes.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 15:</strong> Now cook the noodles in batches in the same stock for about 7-8 minutes. Sieve them out on to the big plate leaving the space in the center for meat. Then add your meat chopped in bite size pieces and put it in the center of the dish. Pour some broth over the meat.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 16:</strong> Sprinkle some chives and parsley to garnish over the top.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 17:</strong> Strain the broth and serve in bowls as shorpa alongside the platter of Beshbarmak
</p>
<p><strong>Step 18:</strong> Beshbarmak is served.

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Preheat oven to 200 degrees; have a baking sheet or heatproof platter ready to keep cooked pancakes warm in the oven. In a small bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt; set aside.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> In a medium bowl, whisk together milk, butter (or oil), and egg. Add dry ingredients to milk mixture; whisk until just moistened (do not overmix; a few small lumps are fine).
</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Heat a large skillet (nonstick or cast-iron) or griddle over medium. Fold a sheet of paper towel in half, and moisten with oil; carefully rub skillet with oiled paper towel.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> For each pancake, spoon 2 to 3 tablespoons of batter onto skillet, using the back of the spoon to spread batter into a round (you should be able to fit 2 to 3 in a large skillet).
</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Cook until surface of pancakes have some bubbles and a few have burst, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip carefully with a thin spatula, and cook until browned on the underside, 1 to 2 minutes more. Transfer to a baking sheet or platter; cover loosely with aluminum foil, and keep warm in oven. Continue with more oil and remaining batter. (You'll have 12 to 15 pancakes.) Serve warm, with desired toppings.
